    <h1>BrewBot</h1>
    <h2>Android Emulator Automation Software</h2>
    <p><cite><a target="_blank" href="https://bitbucket.org/TSP_Disconnected/brewbot/src/master/">BrewBot</a></cite> was my first major brainchild. The idea was to make a program that could automate Android emulators, such as
    BlueStacks and Nox, using image detection. Similar to the functionality of <cite><a target="_blank" href="https://mybot.run/">MyBot</a></cite>, but with the
    ability to work with more than just one Android application. I also used this as an opportunity to get more comfortable with C/C++ and the
    Win32 API. Unfortunately, I have let the application become abandon ware that I will return to sometime soon&trade;.</p>
    <p>Originally, <cite>BrewBot</cite> used the same image detection libraries as <cite>MyBot</cite>, but due to shortcomings of that library I started moving
    <cite>BrewBot</cite> to <cite>OpenCV</cite>. This move allowed for more complex operations; tracking object movement in a video or through a series
    of images being one of the more important ones. I also implemented LUA script support so users can easily make their own scripts for other apps.</p>

    <p>
        I plan on rewriting <cite>BrewBot</cite> from scratch sometime in the future with a linux first mentality, using the Qt framework and true C++ principles.
